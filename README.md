# BLOG-CHALLENGE

Challenge to explore the internal workings of a Rails project through a standard CRUD application.
This blogging app has been created without generating any scaffolds or the usual Rails helpers. So all routes, models, views and controllers were manually coded by myself to have a better understanding of how rails works.
